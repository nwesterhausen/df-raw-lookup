For example, a value of 10 means that it should be able to reach the maximum speed by moving 10 tiles in a straight line over even terrain. <max turning speed> indicates the maximum speed permissible when the creature suddenly changes its direction of motion. The creature's speed will be reduced to <max turning speed> if travelling at a higher speed than this before turning. <energy expenditure> indicates how energy-consuming the gait is. Higher values cause the creature to tire out faster. Persistent usage of a high-intensity gait will eventually lead to exhaustion and collapse. NO_BUILD_UP can be specified instead of a <start speed> value to make the <max speed> instantly achievable upon initiating movement (this is equivalent to a <build up time> of 0). Note that <build up time> and <max turning speed> are both ignored if specified alongside this (as NO_BUILD_UP trumps <build up time> and preserves <max speed> whilst turning, and <max turning speed> cannot exceed <max speed>) so it is permissible to omit them so long as they are both omitted together. It's possible to specify a <start speed> greater than the <max speed>; the moving creature will decelerate towards its <max speed> in this case. valid gait types: WALK Used for moving normally over ground tiles. CRAWL Used for moving over ground tiles whilst prone. SWIM Used for moving through tiles containing water or magma at a depth of at least 4/7. FLY Used for moving through open space. CLIMB Used for moving whilst climbing. valid gait flags: AGILITY Speeds/slows movement depending on the creature's Agility stat. STRENGTH Speeds/slows movement depending on the creature's Strength stat. LAYERS_SLOW Makes THICKENS_ON_ENERGY_STORAGE and THICKENS_ON_STRENGTH tissue layers slow movement depending on how thick they are.
